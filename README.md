<h1>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rafael </h1> 

<p> I'm a Full Stack Developer from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I'm currently learning react native and working on a project that helps users organize important stuff on their cellphones. I'm also trying to learn japanese with games!</p>
<p>As a personal project I hope to use my abilities as a developer to create an app that helps other people learn japanese as well! </p>
